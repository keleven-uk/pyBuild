    V1.04
    
    Added colorama, so print to the console can be in colour - i.e. errors can be in red.
    Changed hard wire to point to Python 3.8.
    Added argument for GUI, if given compile with noconsole.  If this argument is absent, then compile with a console.
    The script didn't work when no arguments and no source where given - fixed.
    
    V1.03

    Changed all paths to use pathlib.
    Improved the output of the --help argument.

    V1.02
    
    Amended all the arguments to be optional, problems with mixing optional
    and positional.  Amended logic to check if required arguments where
    indeed there.

    Added history.txt

    First commit to git of pyBackup.

    V1.01  16 Oct.2019  Added command line arguments and docstrings.
